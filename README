DJD Player is a music player and organizer app for Android. It is based on the standard Music Player from
The Android Open Source Project (which comes pre-installed on many Android phones).

Enhancements over the standard Music Player:

* Genre support:
   - genre browsing tab
   - show genre of currently playing song

* Do not pretend that album is a proper subcategory of artist (one album can contain songs from different artists)
