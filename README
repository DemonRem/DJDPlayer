DJD Player is a music player and organizer app for Android. It is based on the standard Music Player from The Android Open Source Project (which comes pre-installed on many Android phones).

Enhancements over the standard Music Player:

* Genre support:
   - genre browsing tab
   - show genre of currently playing song
   - show genre instead of album in notification

* Do not pretend that album is a proper subcategory of artist (one album can contain songs from different artists)

* Show number of songs for all categories (artist, album, genre) and playlists

* Jump directly to list of songs for artist/album/genre from currently playing song view

* Show next song/artist/genre in currently playing song view

* Always show currently playing song footer in lists

* Play/pause and next button in currently playing song footer

* Improved play queue

* Improved shuffling

* Possible to force rescan of music library
